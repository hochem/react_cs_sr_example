# Sample application: Server-Side Rendering and Code Splitting with React-Router 4

The purpose of this repository is to showcase a working solution for a server-rendered, code-split app with React-Router 4.

Checkout the different branches from s1/* to s5/* to see the transition from a simple react app to a code splitted and server side rendered react app.

Example is based on https://github.com/emilecantin/ssr_code-splitting_sample
